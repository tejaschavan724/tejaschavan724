# Hey, I'm Tejas Chavan 👋

🤖 **Machine Learning Developer | Data Enthusiast | Problem Solver**

I design and build intelligent systems — from **training predictive models** to **deploying them in the real world**. My work spans **data preprocessing, model experimentation, and production-ready ML pipelines**.

---

## 🚀 What I Do

- Turn **raw data** into actionable insights.
- Build **end-to-end ML systems** — from preprocessing to deployment.
- Work with **real-world datasets** in healthcare, IoT, and signal processing.
- Experiment, optimize, and **ship models that work**.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, Java  
- **ML & AI:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost  
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- **Other Tools:** Git/GitHub, Jupyter, Flask, Streamlit

---

## 📌 Featured Projects

- 🩺 **[Heart Disease Predictor](https://github.com/tejaschavan724/heart_disease_project)**  
  Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models for predicting heart disease based on clinical data.

- 📡 **IoT Energy Monitoring Analytics**  
  Time-series ML models predicting energy usage patterns from IoT sensor data.

- 💓 **ECG Signal Processing with ML**  
  Combining feature extraction and classification to detect and filter ECG R-wave peaks.

---

## 🌱 Currently Learning

- **Deep Learning Architectures** (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)  
- **Explainable AI (XAI)** – making model decisions interpretable

---

## 🏗 My Approach

> "A good model isn’t the one with the highest accuracy — it’s the one that works reliably in the real world."

I prioritize **robustness over benchmarks** and love iterating until the solution is **production-ready**.
